# Week 6: Streaming processing 

Streaming processing is a method of processing data in real-time as it is generated, rather than in batch processing after it has been collected. Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform that facilitates the streaming processing of large amounts of data.

Kafka allows for the ingestion and processing of large volumes of data in real-time, making it an essential tool for data engineering. It enables efficient data processing, storage, and analysis of large data sets, as well as the integration of multiple data sources into a single pipeline.

The integration of streaming processing with Apache Kafka provides a reliable and scalable platform for real-time data processing, enabling businesses to make more informed decisions by quickly responding to changing conditions and customer demands. It also helps to ensure data accuracy, improve data quality, and reduce data latency.

In summary, streaming processing and Apache Kafka are critical components in data engineering that help businesses gain valuable insights from their data in real-time, enabling them to make better decisions and stay ahead of the competition.
