# GCP VM SET UP

May be this is one of the most important part of this course, because in the following weeks we will working with this vm, so is really important this set up. 

A VM instance in GCP (Google Cloud Platform) is a virtual machine that runs on Google's infrastructure. It is a fully isolated environment that can be configured and customized to meet specific needs, including CPU, memory, disk space, and network settings.

In data engineering, VM instances are commonly used for running data processing and analysis pipelines. They provide a scalable and efficient way to process and store large amounts of data, with the ability to add or remove resources as needed. Additionally, VM instances in GCP can be easily integrated with other GCP services, such as BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and Dataflow, making it an ideal choice for data engineering workflows.

Overall, VM instances in GCP are a critical component of data engineering, providing the necessary infrastructure and resources for building scalable and efficient data processing pipelines.

## Pre-Requisites
- `Have a GCP account`
- `Git in the local computer`

Now that we have the prerequisites already we can continue with the set up procces

## Step 1. SSH key generation.

Create .ssh dir:

 `mkdir .ssh` 

Change the directory to .ssh directory: 

 `cd .ssh`

Genarate ssh key: 

 `ssh-keygen -t rsa -f <filename> -C <yourname> -b 2048`

SSH keys generation: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/connect/create-ssh-keys?hl=es-419

acces to ssh key: 

 `cat gcp.pub`

Copy the ssh key value and add in metadata section in gcp compute engine


## Step 2. Create a VM 

Go to GCP console, in the section compute engine/ VM instances, clic new instance. 

The create a new VM with ubuntu operative sistem and 30 gb of memory.

## Step 3. Conection with local machine

In the VM instaces tab we can found our vm runnig, well we need to copy the external IP value to conect the vm with our local machine.

`ssh -i ~/.ssh/gcp arturo@ <external IP>`

## Step 4. Configure VM and set up local    

- Install anacoda navegator with the command:

 `wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.10-Linux-x86_64.sh`

or the lasted version: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution

- Then go to the anaconda bash:

 `bash Anaconda3-2022.10-Linux-x86_64.sh`

and accept all terms and conditions

- Create the config file in .ssh dir:

`touch config`

`code config`

This file contains:
            
1. HOST: the name of the vm 
2. HostName: external IP (this ip chages every time that the vm is restarted)
3. User: The name of the user in the ssh keys
4. IdentityFile: The path where is the gcp.pub file
    

Check that the file has been created correctly

-Log in into anaconda with:

`less .bashrc`
    
close the terminal and open a new terminal and put the following comand:

`ssh <vm name>`

Install docker:

        sudo apt-get install docker.io
        sudo apt-get update

Connect vs code with the vm

        intall the extention remote ssh
        clic in the ssh remote, select connect hosts 
        select the host, select the os and enter your ssh file password

Install docker:

        sudo apt-get install docker.io

note that if you try to run docker run hello-world, you will have problems 

run docker command without sudo: https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/main/docker-without-sudo.md
    

Install docker compose

        create a new dir in the root path
            mkdir bin
        change to bin dir
            cd bin
        download docker compose 
            wget https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.16.0/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -O docker-compose

        or the lasted version: https://github.com/docker/compose

        Execute docker-compose
            chmod +x docker-compose
        
    To do visible docker compose from every directory:
        go to root path
        then: nano .bashrc, go to the end and in conda initialize part 
        and type

        export  PATH="${HOME}/bin:${PATH}"

        press control+O to saved , then enter and control+z to exit
    
        source .bashrc
