# Data-engineering-zoomcamp-2023

Data Engineering Zoomcamp by [DataTalks.Club's Slack](https://datatalks.club/slack.html) is an online course designed to teach the fundamentals of data engineering to beginners. The course covers topics such as data modeling, databases, data pipelines, and data warehousing, and is taught through a combination of lectures, hands-on exercises, and real-world examples.

The course is divided into six weeks and is self-paced, allowing students to learn at their own pace. It also includes access to a community of learners and industry professionals, who can provide guidance and support throughout the course.

Data Engineering Zoomcamp is a popular course among aspiring data engineers, data analysts, and data scientists who want to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to work with large and complex datasets.
